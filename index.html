				<h2>Welcome to Keats Island!</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Keats Island is a small-medium sized island of of 6.32 km <sup>2</sup> located in Howe Sound, B.C.,
					Canada, considered part of the Salish sea, and part of the territories of the Squamish Nation
					(Siwxwú7mesh Úxwumixw). Nowadays, human influenced clearing of the previously forested landscape
					covers ca. 0.27 km<sup>2</sup> (4.3%) of the land surface.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two areas considered as parks, which cover 0.19 km <sup>2</sup> (3.08%) of the island.
					Part
					of the resilience of Keats' ecosystem can be attributed to a low density population and seasonal
					visitors. There are pockets of habitation, including Eastbourne, Melody Point and Keats Camp,
					but a lot of it is empty and privately owned. The island has trails that
					traverse much of the rest of the Island, but many of those trails are on private land.

				<h2>The Keats Island Conservation Society</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The primary focus of the society is to reinforce a sense of community driven towards understanding
					and protecting nature.
					Trail maintenance, invasive species removal and frequent communication with land owners and other
					organizations in the Howe Sound Biospehere Region are among the most proactive areas in which the
					KICS is involved.

				<h2>Keats Island is rich in poorly known species!</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Residents of the island share their homes with a diverse community of species, in both terrestrial
					and marine environments. Many of these species are arthropods, crustaceans and animals too small to
					see with the naked eye. To know them and protect them is to ensure the stability of the environment
					at its foundation because these communities serve as a food source for more charismatic species,
					like salmon.
				</p>
				<p>
					To help document and protect this diversity, some especialized members of the KICS use their
					expertise in microscopy, ornithology, and restoration to elaborate catalogs and inventories that
					document and communicate these species.

				<h2>The ocean connects us</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Given its size, Keats Island has a high proportion of shorelines relative to bigger islands in the
					region.
					This makes events in the Salish sea specially noticeable to keats islanders. But the mysterious
					nature of the ocean that drives people to it also makes it difficult to study. The KICS ensures the
					identification of 'indicator' species, whose presence and absence in the shorelines communicates
					changes in the diversity and quality of the oceans.

				<h2>A haven for migratory species</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Residents of Howe Sound are often visited by migratory species of killer whales, sea lions, and
					birds. These species use the region to replenish energy resources and secure a safe commute towards
					their final destinations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other, equally majestic species like the bald eagle are instead residents throughout the year,
					raising their chicks in the safety of the forest's canopy. A big part of the reasoning that
					justifies the protection of these and other species
					in the island is the same behing why most human residents and visitors are so strongly attracted to
					nature when they visit the island.
